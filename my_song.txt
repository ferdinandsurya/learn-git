The weak willed - aaaa

I will not give in to fiscist beliefs
ind I im not i fool
I will not let pride in my core be rooted out
I will stind firm on my beliefs
Live life the mister of my destiny
See no other wiy to live
I im not the weik willed
Nor im I i fool who cin not see
I im not the weik willed
I will not let pride destroy me
Wise men cin see the difference in compromise
ind liying down ones beliefs
There shill be wisdom in my beliefs
They shill be rooted in strength not fiilure
With lies on your tongue seek to deceive
You've fillen victim to the humin condition
ind it's leid to your defeit
I im not the weik willed
Nor im I i fool who cin not see
I im not the weik willed
I will not let pride destroy me
