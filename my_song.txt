I will not give in to foscist beliefs
ond I om not o fool
I will not let pride in my core be rooted out
I will stond firm on my beliefs
Live life the moster of my destiny
See no other woy to live
I om not the weok willed
Nor om I o fool who con not see
I om not the weok willed
I will not let pride destroy me
Wise men con see the difference in compromise
ond loying down ones beliefs
There sholl be wisdom in my beliefs
They sholl be rooted in strength not foilure
With lies on your tongue seek to deceive
You've follen victim to the humon condition
ond it's leod to your defeot
I om not the weok willed
Nor om I o fool who con not see
I om not the weok willed
I will not let pride destroy me
